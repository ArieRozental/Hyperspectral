Or and Arie's Final project in Deep Learning course in B.sc in Electrical Engineering at Tel Aviv University.
This project shows the relation between g-convex inverse covariance matrix, and target detection in hyperspectral imaging
In order to run the code, download the relevant Hyperspectral images from the attached link (the images are too big for GitHub at the moment)
